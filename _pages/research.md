Cloud processes occur across a wide spectrum of scales, from sub-micrometer dimensions (Cloud Condensation Nuclei) to thousands of kilometers (cloud systems). However, current numerical models lack the capacity to explicitly address this entire range of scales. Furthermore, interactions among numerous aspects, including cloud microphysics, precipitation, moist turbulence, latent heat release, circulation, and radiation, complicate the problem. 

Our research focuses on addressing challenges across three main areas: 1) Cloud formation and evolution over heterogeneous land and oceanic surfaces, 2) the life cycle of cloud populations, including interactions among clouds and their surrounding environments, and 3) aerosol-cloud interactions, particularly the impact of aerosols on cloud size distribution and lifecycle. We approach these topics in an integrated manner, utilizing cloud parcel models, direct numerical simulations (DNS), large eddy simulations (LES), mesoscale regional models, and observational datasets.
