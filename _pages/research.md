Cloud processes occur across a wide spectrum of scales, from sub-micrometer dimensions (Cloud Condensation Nuclei) to thousands of kilometers (cloud systems). However, current numerical models lack the capacity to explicitly address this entire range of scales. Furthermore, interactions among numerous aspects, including cloud microphysics, precipitation, moist turbulence, latent heat release, circulation, and radiation, complicate the problem. 

Our research focuses on addressing challenges across three main areas: 1) Cloud formation and evolution over heterogeneous land and oceanic surfaces, 2) the life cycle of cloud populations, including interactions among clouds and their surrounding environments, and 3) aerosol-cloud interactions, particularly the impact of aerosols on cloud size distribution and lifecycle. We approach these topics in an integrated manner, utilizing cloud parcel models, direct numerical simulations (DNS), large eddy simulations (LES), mesoscale regional models, and observational datasets.

Topic 1: Interactions among land, the boundary layer, and clouds
-

Landscape heterogeneities induce secondary circulation by modifying the surface fluxes and their partitioning into sensible and latent heat fluxes, which contributes to the formation of planetary boundary layer characteristics and convective clouds. Variations in the landscape include different soil moisture levels and land-use types over land, as well as sea surface temperatures (SST) over the ocean.

Our previous research over the Southern Great Plain focused on the impacts of soil moisture heterogeneity on the timing, location, and intensities of shallow convective clouds [6,13]. Our studies, using isentropic analysis, showed that the isentropes associated with upward motion connect to the ground characterized by high latent heat fluxes, while isentropes associated with downward motion connect precipitation to the ground characterized by high sensible heat fluxes. The mixing of dry, warm parcels ascending from the ground with high sensible heat fluxes and moist parcels from high latent heat regions leads to cloud formation. This new mechanism explains how soil moisture heterogeneity provides the key ingredients, such as buoyancy and moisture, for shallow cloud formation. We also found that sub-mesoscale processes dominate upward energy transport in the boundary layer, while mesoscale circulations contribute to vertical energy transport above the boundary layer.


We continue to explore various heterogeneous types, including variations in Sea Surface Temperature (SST) over oceans and urbanization-induced land-use changes [11]. This kind of research explores "realistic" scenarios by separating the roles of multiple factors in cloud formation. It illustrates when, where, and why clouds form and evolve, contributing to our understanding of regional cloud-related phenomena such as local precipitation.


Topic 2: Interactions among clouds and surrounding environments

Some of the climate research puzzles are related to a limited understanding of the critical factors governing the life cycle of cumulus clouds. These factors influence the initiation and the various mixing processes during the cloud's life cycle. However, current representations of convective clouds are based on 'bulk' environments and 'cylinder' cloud assumptions, without considering the cloud evolution from a 'population' perspective and ignoring the three-dimensional structure of clouds. 

To shed some light into these processes, we tracked the life cycle of thousands of individual shallow cumulus clouds in a large-eddy simulation during the DOE field campaign in the U.S. southern Great Plains [12,18]. We found that clouds with growing neighboring clouds form above regions with larger surface heterogeneity, whereas clouds with decaying neighboring clouds are associated with less heterogeneous surfaces. Also, those with decaying neighboring clouds experience larger instability and a more humid boundary layer, indicating evaporation below the cloud base is likely occurring before those clouds are formed. Larger instability leads to higher vertical velocity and convergence within the cloud, which causes stronger surrounding downdrafts and water vapor removal in the surrounding area. The latter appears to be the reason for the decaying neighboring clouds.

Another work by using the same datasets reveals that cloud edge irregularity-driven cloud perimeter growth strongly indicates cloud splitting, with a more pronounced effect than aspect ratio-driven perimeter growth [18]. Smaller cloud-shell gradients of properties across cloud boundaries are associated with more irregular clouds, suggesting enhanced mixing of clouds with the cloud-free environment. These findings indicate that the shallow cumulus evolution is partly driven by the irregularity of the cloud edge through lateral mixing and cloud splitting.

We continue to explore interactions between clouds and their surrounding environments under different cloud regimes in both idealized and realistic scenarios using large eddy simualtions, field and remote sensing obaservations. These studies will help to represent convective cloud development from a "population" perspective and contribute to a better understanding and parameterization of the upscale growth and dissipation of clouds in their lifecycles.

Topic 3: Aerosol-cloud interactions 
- 

Aerosols, serving as cloud condensation nuclei, impact the evolution of cloud droplets. An increase in aerosol number concentration (Na) leads to increases in cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and cloud droplet number concentration (Nc), which in turn reduces droplet sizes and enhances cloud albedo when liquid water remains unchanged (i.e., albedo effect). Additionally, the increased Na leads to concurrent increases in Nc and relative dispersion (ε) of the cloud droplet size distribution, defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean radius of the droplet size distribution (i.e., dispersion effect). The enhanced ε negates the number effect and may be partly responsible for the overestimated indirect aerosol effect and the discrepancy between model estimates of the indirect aerosol effect and those constrained by observations. Furthermore, increasing aerosols are thought to reduce the cloud droplet size and enhance the suspension time of clouds (i.e., lifetime effects). Another compensating effect from reduced cloud droplet size relies on entrainment-evaporation feedbacks -- smaller droplets are prone to evaporate and reduce the suspension time of clouds (entrainment-evaporation effect). All these above mentioned effects occur simultaneously, which complicates the net effects of aerosols on clouds.

Our early work focus on the regime classification of disperion effect [1,2]. We show, using a new parcel model, that combined consideration of Nc and relative dispersion better characterizes the regime dependence of aerosol-cloud interactions than considering Nc alone. Given updraft velocity (w), ε increases with increasing Na in the aerosol-limited regime, peaks in the transitional regime, and decreases with further increasing Na in the updraft-limited regime. This new finding further reconciles contrasting observations in literature and reinforces the compensating role of dispersion effect. The nonmonotonic behavior of ε further quantifies the relationship between the transitional Na and w that separates the aerosol- and updraft-limited regimes.

We continue to explore the aerosol-cloud interactions by considering entrained aerosols [5]. Secondary activation of these entrained aerosols is thought to modify the cloud droplet size distribution. Future work is aimed at quantifying the effects of entrained aerosols on the evolution of cloud droplet distribution and associated impacts on precipitation using a cloud parcel model, large eddy simulations, and cloud chamber experiments.
