Mentoring Philosophy
-
My aim is to contribute to your professional and personal growth -- some universal skill in recognizing opportunities, asking questions, solving problems, and communicating effectively. To start, I am interested in learning about your current intellectual and professional progress, as well as your future dreams. While academic achievement often emphasizes the mantra of "publish or perish," I also aspire to inspire you to recognize the broad impact of your work. I believe that great self-motivation stems from happiness, a sense of achievement, and self-empowerment. I hope that our collaboration will be a fulfilling and joyful journey, guiding you from the role of student to that of researcher or employee in your future career.
